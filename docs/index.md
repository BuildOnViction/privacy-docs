# Introduction Tomochain privacy
TomoChain offers native privacy support in the EVM core layer by providing a set of precompiled contracts for proven privacy techniques, including Ring Confidential Transaction, Bulletproofs, and Zksnarks. In the second layer, SDK, application-specific smart contracts, and a new private token standard will be provided for third-parties to issue private tokens on TomoChain and to build DApps with privacy support.
